  abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

  abstract = {Even though human movement and mobility patterns have a high degree of freedom and variation, they also exhibit structural patterns due to geographic and social constraints. Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10\% to 30\% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50\% to 70\%. Based on our findings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of select substructures is an indicator of network effects in applications such as social network analysis and systems biology. Moreover, subgraph statistics are pervasive in stochastic network models, and they need to be assessed repeatedly in MCMC sampling and estimation algorithms. We present a new approach to count all induced and non-induced 4-node subgraphs (the quad census) on a per-node and per-edge basis, complete with a separation into their non-automorphic roles in these subgraphs. It is the first approach to do so in a unified manner, and is based on only a clique-listing subroutine. Computational experiments indicate that, despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms previous, less general approaches.},
